### About this Game...
The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a shared universe created by Marvel Studios, set primarily in the reality designated as Earth-199999 within Marvel's multiverse system. Starting with Iron Man, the universe is comprised mainly of films independently made by Marvel Studios, that are always set within this same universe, much like Marvel has done with their comics.
I have been a Marvel fan since I was a kid, so this project was extra fun for me.
